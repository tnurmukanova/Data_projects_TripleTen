## Data Source
You can view the Google Spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TYWBCm1KB-y_fUC5UAN0yfgreV6RVH_RHfrU8BLmgb0/edit?gid=203310248#gid=203310248).

You've learned a lot ‚Äî now it's time to apply your new knowledge and skills to the sprint project. 

This time, as with all TripleTen projects, you'll be given data and asked to analyze it to solve a real-world business need. 

When you finish your project, submit it for review. You'll receive comments within 24 hours. Make changes based on the reviewer's advice and resubmit an updated version. You may receive new comments. It's normal to make several rounds of changes before the project is accepted. 

Once the reviewer accepts your project ‚Äî it's considered complete!

To make sure we‚Äôre evaluating your work in a fair and consistent way, we‚Äôve created a rubric for this project. This document outlines the criteria and standards that we‚Äôll use to grade your project. We recommend you use this as a guide throughout your development process. This way, you can ensure that your project meets expectations and demonstrates your level of mastery on this topic.

## Guidelines
You'll find a detailed description of the research process in the next lesson. Here, we'll just discuss the main points:

This is your research. If you find an interesting tendency in the data, add your observations to the spreadsheet. * Just make sure to follow the instructions, test your hypotheses, and meet the deadline.

* Format matters. Writing style is critical. Pay attention to the way headings and conclusions are formatted and maintain consistency. An analyst's job isn't just to crunch numbers, it's to clearly communicate them with your stakeholders and customers. Practice like it's real.

* Documentation will help during the project review. Utilize the techniques you learned in ‚ÄúSharing Your Work with Others‚Äù to make your spreadsheet easy to understand and navigate. The spreadsheets you'll build as a full-time data analyst will be reviewed and audited by your peers, managers, and stakeholders, so it‚Äôs never too soon to start building good habits.

* You've already succeeded. You've already completed a lot of tasks and proved you're ready for this. You may sometimes find it hard to understand certain details, but that's natural, as you're only starting to dive into your new profession. Don't hesitate to ask questions in the Hub.
